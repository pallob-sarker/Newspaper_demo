                        <br>The Bangladesh National team were supposed to leave the country for Sri Lanka tomorrow for their planned upcoming three-Test series against the Island nation next month. Akram also confirmed today that that, however, is not happening as the BCB still awaits a response from the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) regarding a revised tour guideline.<br><br><br>
A 27-member preliminary squad had returned to group training last Sunday after a long hiatus with the BCB creating a bio-secure bubble for the players and staff involved in the camp ahead of their potential tour of Sri Lanka.<br><br>
                            The Bangladesh National team were supposed to leave the country for Sri Lanka tomorrow for their planned upcoming three-Test series against the Island nation next month. Akram also confirmed today that that, however, is not happening as the BCB still awaits a response from the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) regarding a revised tour guideline.<br><br><br>

"We were supposed to leave for Sri Lanka tomorrow but we are not being able to do so. Head coach [Russel Domingo], selectors and BCB CEO [Nizamuddin Chowdhury] sat for a meeting and decided to give a three-day break to the players. We will return to training after three days and we hope that we will get a response from the SLC in two-three days," said Akram.<br><br>

Players have been given this three-day break to be with their families. All the players will return to training following a coronavirus test with the BCB re-creating a bio-secure bubble for the camp.<br><br>
<p class="start">The BCB however hopes to go on the tour at the start of next month.</p> <br>

"If everything remains positive, we hope to go on the tour sometime between the 7th and 10th of the next month. Since their [Lankan] Premier League (LPL) has also been delayed, so they also have time," added Akram.<br><br>

The BCB had earlier refused to tour Sri Lanka under what the BCB president Nazmul Hassan termed as "historically unique" protocols and had communicated their stance with the SLC.<br><br>

SLC has been in constant touch with their health ministry in order to give BCB a revised guideline for the tour. But the SLC mentioned that they would be compelled to call off the tour if the BCB refuses to comply with the revised health protocol to be given by their health ministry in the coming days.
