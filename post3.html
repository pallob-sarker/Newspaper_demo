                        <p>"We are holding talks so that Biman can get access to different countries and have been working to upgrade Biman in every aspect such as its security and services," she said, referring to Wednesday's deal with the US in this connection.</p><br>
                        <p>The premier also said her government has been passing necessary laws as demanded by the international organisations so that Biman can fly to different countries, and likewise carriers of other countries can come to Bangladesh.</p><br>
                        <p>The PM was speaking while inaugurating the newly constructed Pani Bhaban, the 13-storey Parjatan Bhaban (headquarters of Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation) at Sher-e-Banglanagar, mural of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in front of the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport and Bangabandhu Corner inside the airport, after being connected virtually from her official Gono Bhaban residence.</p><br>
                        <p>At the function, the prime minister also laid foundation stone of the construction works of Sylhet International Airport Extension Project (phase-1).</p><br>
                        <p>Concerned ministers and officials got connected from the Gono Bhaban, Pani Bhaban (Bangladesh Water Development Board) on the city's Green Road, and Osmani International Airport, Sylhet through video conference.</p><br>
                        <p>The premier greeted concerned officials as Bangladesh and the US governments on Wednesday signed Air Service Agreement that will pave the way to resume direct air connectivity between Dhaka and different cities in the US.</p><br>
                        <p>Referring to adding 13 modern aircraft to the Biman fleet during the tenure of her government, she said, "Since we have purchased some Boeing aircraft, we have a desire to develop direct air connectivity with different countries."</p><br>
                        <p>Sheikh Hasina said that Bangladesh would be the most ideal place to develop a bridge between the East and the West due to its geographical location.</p><br>
                        <p>Spelling out various programmes taken by her government for the development of the aviation sector, she said that after assuming office in 1996, they have built Chattogram Airport and upgraded it to international level, established Sylhet airport as an international one and made Dhaka airport as a modern one with building all necessary infrastructures, including boarding bridge area.</p>
